=======

I used NetBeans (an IDE) to create the server. Download that and then try 
clicking File > Open Project to load in the project. The you should be able to
click the root directory of the project (NearestFinderServer) and click the green
play button at the top of the IDE. This will start up the server and load the 
index.html page. Within Chrome, right click on the page, click inspect element
then when the developer tools pops up, click on the Console tab. You should see
a number of messages. These messages are the result of ajax requests that I wrote
within the js/ajaxExamples.js file. The ajax requests are requesting information from
the server. There is one ajax request that is fired when clicking within the window
of the web page. Do this and you should see a response in the console.
